# chatbot-application
This chatbot application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface designed using the Tkinter library in Python. 
It features a straightforward layout where users can input their queries in a text field and receive real-time responses displayed in a conversation format.
The application leverages basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user inputs, making it capable of handling a variety of simple interactions. 
The Tkinter-based interface ensures that the chatbot is easy to use and interact with, providing a practical demonstration of how to create a functional chatbot using Python.
This project highlights the integration of NLP and GUI development within a single application, showcasing the potential of Python for building interactive and engaging user interfaces.

# here is the explanation of the project:-
1. Imports and Setup
a)	Import Libraries:-
•	tkinter and tkinter.scrolledtext: Used to create the GUI application.
•	requests: Used to make HTTP requests to the Hugging Face API.
b)	API Configuration:-
•	API_URL: The URL endpoint for the Hugging Face BERT model.
•	headers: Contains the authorization token needed to access the API. Replace "hf_wiHvXMOuzIypWbtsPnheQEmoSMvdqrzuxqO" with my actual token.

2 .Functions:- 	
a)	query(payload):
•	This function takes a payload (a dictionary with input data) and sends a POST request to the Hugging Face API.
•	It returns the JSON response from the API.
b)	get_response():
•	This function retrieves the user's question and context from the text fields.
•	It sends these inputs to the query function to get a response from the API.
•	The response is displayed in the response text area of the GUI.
•	If there is a KeyError (e.g., if the API response doesn't contain the expected answer key), it displays an error message.

3. GUI Setup:- 
a)	Main Window:
•	root = tk.Tk(): Initializes the main window of the application.
•	root.title("GenAI QUES & ANS"): Sets the title of the window.
b)	Context Input:
•	A label (context_label) and a scrolled text widget (context_entry) for the user to input the context.
•	pack() methods are used to add these widgets to the window.
c)	Question Input:
•	A label (question_label) and a scrolled text widget (question_entry) for the user to input the question.
•	These widgets are also added to the window using pack().
d)	Get Response Button:
•	A button (get_response_button) that triggers the get_response function when clicked.
•	Added to the window using pack().
e)	Response Display:
•	A label (response_label) and a scrolled text widget (response_text) for displaying the response from the API.
•	The response text area is initially disabled to prevent user edits.

4. Main Loop:-
•	root.mainloop(): Starts the Tkinter event loop, which keeps the window open and responsive to user inputs.
